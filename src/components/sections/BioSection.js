      Making people laugh has been one of David’s fundamental passions. Being
      raised on a staple diet of British comedy led him to perform in his early
      teens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirsty for knowledge, David completed an advanced diploma in stage and
      screen acting, meanwhile performing in various short films and with
      established improv companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ​David has since walked the boards for musical theatre, Shakespeare and
      more. Now writing and filming his own pieces, David still enjoys
      spontaneously comic interactions with unsuspecting public audiences.
